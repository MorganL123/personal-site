Read this // to remember every part of me // before I leave // and my existence will become a // remnant of your memory // nothing more // and nothing else 

my face // is compromised by ill-willed freckles // shaped like stars // pigmented chocolate drops // luring in wide-eyed children // birth marks long-lived // by predestination 

my shoulders // are arbitrarily hunched // tentatively lurched forward // permanently inverted 

my hair // is stained like the color of charcoal against white // diaphanous filigrees assembled against the hostile // sun and all her friends

my lips // are a lustrous pink // purse into the most // delectable but genuine smile // you would find hard to miss // and even harder to forget

my hands // are riddled with frostbite // when impending fear halts the jig in my step // tears seep my gossamer mittens // scars conjure up the battles // I've won // surmountable to the sacrifices I've made // and the people I've lost

my legs // are long-limbed tools of destruction // obstructions never supple enough for me to show my appreciation // now I smile at the realization 

my eyes // are transparent lenses // peering into the minutiae of a // silent world // curtains fall away on opening night 

my toes // are purposely mysterious // its insecurities disguised by subtle hints of // love, adoration // stubby little ones // never seem to disappoint 

my mind // is loud and quiet // platitudes of thoughts // ebb and flow // overpass mountains of feelings // overwhelmed by rapture 

my words // are whispers // collide with voluminous streams of wild conscious // waiting to be screamed // or better yet captured 

my heart // is worn // from clinging to false hope // to fill an empty void from // running only to be outrun 

my soul // was a wanderer // traveling night and day // among impoverished wayfarers // until you listened to my // story // and brought me home

I am everything // to you now // and nothing to this world

you drink your liquid
wine like sanguine blood
staining laceless shoes in
dead of day, loss of night

you criticize classless society
ScReEcHes blanket virgin earlobes of
children caged in metal bars.
the rusting iron ceases to dissolve.

my love, you sing of tunes
of blues of irony through
hums of trough, fear of ambiguity.
rustling angelic feathers to be mysterious

wrinkles crease your forehead.
the purse of your lips bounding loveless sorrow
pride, overcomes every mile
of skin. every decibel of your inner voice

inhale and exhale. exercises will never amount to
the unwinding of thoughts spiraling through
hourglass vines of string...
grains of sand intertwined

your eyes blend
into mine and suddenly,
once again suddenly
we are equals.

Trails of petroleum follow my footsteps, thick particles of sweet smelling smoke
sellers with deceptive smiles
beads of sweat line their forehead, carry rows of bejeweled shoes
restless streets with scattered sokos

bountiful groves of spicy cinnamon tantalize every part of my tongue
fill me with the pungent scent of nutmeg 
enveloped in plastic-like cherry lace

hands slathered in lemongrass perfume, yellow liquid sloshing in a glass vial
crushed berbere, speckled tongue of orange flakes
cannabis disguised as innocent clove
paper curls at the light of burning fire
pockets of spice, aroma of sage cardamom and burnt masala wafting through the atmosphere

now,
the hilltop from my view is a dilapidated church
with tormented slabs and weatherbeaten walls
ornate petals arranged in rows upon rows on Indian sycamore doors
pelican-beaked bullets protruding from each gold encrusted flower

the tiny houses with pale yellow,
periwinkle coverings appear more majestic than the modern ones
as the motorbikes, their engines greet us with the sound of kernels popping under heat
pillowy air presses against my scarred palm, rough fingers

a strange feeling,
beautiful women obscure their faces in vibrant linens
stories screaming to be unveiled

we laugh, we sing, and we complain about our feet
even though the people passing by have walked farther
without stopping

Africa is a breathtaking beauty.
Asante

which yesterday,
seemed difficult to do.
the moments of dread        
once I had
faced my tears
made me feel
I was
forgetting you.
    
though
you visit me in warm
flickers of cathartic
incense lighting, through
sundry smells
    
in fresh-cut roses,
hand-picked from a
gardener’s gloves
    
in plastic, tiny
dancers with missing ballet slippers
on Christmas day
and off-beat notes,
letters lifting from the page
    
if I can remember this
today,
I will wipe the tears off
my face
and still
remember you
tomorrow.

A maze, the train station
With bad connection
Seizes the worst of my imagination

In a single breath
Your life could be taken away
By the wheels of a moving train

A woman
With a smile
A job
A daughter
she loves

Push from a stranger
Cautionless step

No one hears
Her screams
No one helps

Voice suppressed 
Loses hope
Smells the sweet scent
Of her daughter’s
Hair

Mixed with
Urine and
Metal wheels

Last breath
To her daughter

Body mangled 
Blood trickles
Alone

No one hears
No one helps
All alone

Grief.

Death
Cold
Desire

These words replayed
in my head
as my life flashed 
before my eyes

Quicker than a clap of thunder
On a 
stormy,
ominous night.

Death
Cold
Desire

I will
never forget
how fast I ran
For freedom to 
escape my death

The man I once knew 
And loved
shackled me with chains so tight
I could barely move

All because of his love
for me
A restraining desire that
couldn’t be 
reckoned with

Death
Cold 
Desire

Passion  
And fervor

Longing for a man
to rescue me
With
loving arms
To free me from 
my shackles

Death
Cold
Desire

Streaks of yellow
pass by me

Life violently extinguished
In a blink
of an eye

Love
All because
Of love

Left me
Dead and alone
On a cold,
Heartless ground

Why did I trust 
this man to save me?

Took
the life I lost before
Away from me
Once more

Left my body 
Mangled
Thick,
Cold blood

As I faded away
as a ghostly
Apparition
In a whisper of smoke

All I could 
think of
Was

Death
Cold
Desire

Three words 
That left me
With 
No words
At all.
