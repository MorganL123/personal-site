Read this // to remember every part of me // before I leave // and my existence will become a // remnant of your memory // nothing more // and nothing else 

my face // is compromised by ill-willed freckles // shaped like stars // pigmented chocolate drops // luring in wide-eyed children // birth marks long-lived // by predestination 

my shoulders // are arbitrarily hunched // tentatively lurched forward // permanently inverted 

my hair // is stained like the color of charcoal against white // diaphanous filigrees assembled against the hostile // sun and all her friends

my lips // are a lustrous pink // purse into the most // delectable but genuine smile // you would find hard to miss // and even harder to forget

my hands // are riddled with frostbite // when impending fear halts the jig in my step // tears seep my gossamer mittens // scars conjure up the battles // I've won // surmountable to the sacrifices I've made // and the people I've lost

my legs // are long-limbed tools of destruction // obstructions never supple enough for me to show my appreciation // now I smile at the realization 

my eyes // are transparent lenses // peering into the minutiae of a // silent world // curtains fall away on opening night 

my toes // are purposely mysterious // its insecurities disguised by subtle hints of // love, adoration // stubby little ones // never seem to disappoint 

my mind // is loud and quiet // platitudes of thoughts // ebb and flow // overpass mountains of feelings // overwhelmed by rapture 

my words // are whispers // collide with voluminous streams of wild conscious // waiting to be screamed // or better yet captured 

my heart // is worn // from clinging to false hope // to fill an empty void from // running only to be outrun 

my soul // was a wanderer // traveling night and day // among impoverished wayfarers // until you listened to my // story // and brought me home

I am everything // to you now // and nothing to this world

        <div class="poem" style="text-align: left;"> 
you drink your liquid
wine like sanguine blood
staining laceless shoes in
dead of day, loss of night

you criticize classless society
ScReEcHes blanket virgin earlobes of
children caged in metal bars.
the rusting iron ceases to dissolve.

my love, you sing of tunes
of blues of irony through
hums of trough, fear of ambiguity.
rustling angelic feathers to be mysterious

wrinkles crease your forehead.
the purse of your lips bounding loveless sorrow
pride, overcomes every mile
of skin. every decibel of your inner voice

inhale and exhale. exercises will never amount to
the unwinding of thoughts spiraling through
hourglass vines of string...
grains of sand intertwined

your eyes blend
into mine and suddenly,
once again suddenly
we are equals.

    <div class="poem" style="text-align: left;"> 
Trails of petroleum follow my footsteps, thick particles of sweet smelling smoke
sellers with deceptive smiles
beads of sweat line their forehead, carry rows of bejeweled shoes
restless streets with scattered sokos

bountiful groves of spicy cinnamon tantalize every part of my tongue
fill me with the pungent scent of nutmeg 
enveloped in plastic-like cherry lace

hands slathered in lemongrass perfume, yellow liquid sloshing in a glass vial
crushed berbere, speckled tongue of orange flakes
cannabis disguised as innocent clove
paper curls at the light of burning fire
pockets of spice, aroma of sage cardamom and burnt masala wafting through the atmosphere

now,
the hilltop from my view is a dilapidated church
with tormented slabs and weatherbeaten walls
ornate petals arranged in rows upon rows on Indian sycamore doors
pelican-beaked bullets protruding from each gold encrusted flower

the tiny houses with pale yellow,
periwinkle coverings appear more majestic than the modern ones
as the motorbikes, their engines greet us with the sound of kernels popping under heat
pillowy air presses against my scarred palm, rough fingers

a strange feeling,
beautiful women obscure their faces in vibrant linens
stories screaming to be unveiled

we laugh, we sing, and we complain about our feet
even though the people passing by have walked farther
without stopping

Africa is a breathtaking beauty.
Asante

    <h1>Ode to wiping the tears off my face</h1>

    <div class="poem" style="text-align: left;"> 
which yesterday,
seemed difficult to do.
the moments of dread        
once I had
faced my tears
made me feel
I was
forgetting you.
    
though
you visit me in warm
flickers of cathartic
incense lighting, through
sundry smells
    
in fresh-cut roses,
hand-picked from a
gardener’s gloves
    
in plastic, tiny
dancers with missing ballet slippers
on Christmas day
and off-beat notes,
letters lifting from the page
    
if I can remember this
today,
I will wipe the tears off
my face
and still
remember you
tomorrow.

I breathe words
Letters upon letters 
One by one, they
Fall from my lips
Strung together
And enter the abyss
Unknown strangers

My words
In your hands
In your palms
In your heart
Resonating in your mind

You ask me
What is your dream,

You ask,
I answer

Sound asleep
A fantasy
Where the princesses 
Are spoken of their
prowess,
Of valor, their power
Courage through
Squalor —
to become
warriors

No —
what is your real dream


You ask,
I answer

My words
power
Letters upon letters
Strung together 
To tell stories 

For you to 
Listen, for you
to wonder how your
Palms
Those soft, 
Hard, beaten, hurt hands
Have power
Though  
In words you say and sing
To one another

No, what is your long term dream
In a year, a decade
Hours, minutes
Seconds away

You ask,
I answer

A
single smile 

Gifted to me 
from the
Children I have
Lifted, their
faces overflowing
With joy, their
Voices filling a vacant
Room, once empty
Deadly silent

A 
single smile

Brought to me by 
my hands
Rough, gnarled as leather
Lips dry as the desert
Knees scarred, shaken from the
Hostile wind, envious stars
I have persisted

A 
single smile 

Passed down to me from
My ancestors
who have cried from 
Oppression
Have had their life
Their possessions 
Stripped violently away from 
Them

To give me a home
To give me their hope
Their Long-lost smiles
Grinning down upon me

A 
single smile

Reminding me 
I am my own person
I am enough
Neither the wind can sway me from standing on my ground
Nor the fire hush me to sleep when no one’s around

A
single smile

Instilling me power
To speak my words
To speak my truth
To be who I am 
Fearlessly 

What is your dream?

You ask 
I answered.
